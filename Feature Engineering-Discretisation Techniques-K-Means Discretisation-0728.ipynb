    "## Discretisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Discretisation is the process of transforming continuous variables into discrete variables by creating a set of contiguous intervals that span the range of the variable's values. Discretisation is also called **binning**, where bin is an alternative name for interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discretisation helps handle outliers and may improve value spread in skewed variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Discretisation helps handle outliers by placing these values into the lower or higher intervals, together with the remaining inlier values of the distribution. Thus, these outlier observations no longer differ from the rest of the values at the tails of the distribution, as they are now all together in the same interval / bucket. In addition, by creating appropriate bins or intervals, discretisation can help spread the values of a skewed variable across a set of bins with equal number of observations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discretisation approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches to transform continuous variables into discrete ones. Discretisation methods fall into 2 categories: **supervised and unsupervised**. Unsupervised methods do not use any information, other than the variable distribution, to create the contiguous bins in which the values will be placed. Supervised methods typically use target information in order to create the bins or intervals.\n",
